Great are You Lord; mighty in strength
You are faithful; You will ever be
We will praise You; all of our days
It's for Your glory; we offer everything

Raise your hands, all Your nations
Shout to God, all creation
How awesome is the Lord most high
We will praise You together
For now and forever
How awesome is the Lord most high


When you send us; God we will go
You're the answer; we want the world to know
We will trust You; when You call our name
When You lead us; we'll follow all the way


Hallelujah;  Hallelujah
How awesome is the Lord most high.
