Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
and Grace will lead me home.

My chains are gone, 
Iâ€™ve been set free
My God, my Saviour, has ransomed me
And like a flood, His mercy reigns
Unending love, amazing grace

The Lord has promised good to us
His word our hope secures
He will our shield and portion be
As long as life endures
