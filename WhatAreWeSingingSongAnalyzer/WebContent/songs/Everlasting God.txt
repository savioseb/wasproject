Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord 
We will wait upon the Lord; we will wait upon the Lord 

Our God, You reign forever 
Our hope, our strong deliverer 

You are the everlasting God, the everlasting God 
You do not faint, You grow weary 
You the defender of the weak 
You comfort those in need 
You lift us up on wings like eagles
