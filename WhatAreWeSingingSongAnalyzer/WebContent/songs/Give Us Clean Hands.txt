 We bow our hearts, we bend our knees
 O Spirit come make us humble
We turn our eyes from evil things
O Lord we cast down our idols

Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another

O God let us be a generation that seeks
that seeks your face O God of Jacob
O God let us be a generation that seeks
that seeks your face O God of Jacob
