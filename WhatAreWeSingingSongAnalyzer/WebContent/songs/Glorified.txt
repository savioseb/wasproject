Praise belongs to You let every kingdom bow
Let every ocean roar
Let every heart adore You now

Praise belongs to You what can I do but sing
The greatest joy Ive found
Is to lay a crown before my King            before my King

Ive come to worship Ive come to lift up Your name
For You deserve this life laid down
Like the one that You gave
I have but one voice one heart and one sacrifice
So would You take this life laid down
And be glorified
Be glorified
