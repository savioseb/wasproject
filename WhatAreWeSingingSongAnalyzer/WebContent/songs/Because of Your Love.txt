Jesus you endured my pain
Savior you bore all my shame
All because of your love

Maker of the universe 
Broken for the sins of the earth
All because of your love
All because of your love

Because of your cross my debt is paid
Because of your blood my sins are washed away
Now all of my life, I freely give
Because of your love, Because of your love I live

Innocent and holy king
You died to set the captives free 
All because of your love      
Lord you gave your life for me
I will live my life for you
All because of your love      
All because of your love

You did it for me, you did it for love
Itâ€™s your victory, Jesus you are enough
