Before the throne of God above 
I have a strong, a perfect plea
A great high priest whose name is love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me
My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart 
I know that while in heavâ€™n He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart;	  No tongue can bid me thence depart 
	When Satan tempts me to despair 
	And tells me of the guilt within  
	Upward I look and see Him there
	Who made an end to all my sin 
	Because this sinless Saviour died 
	My sinful soul is counted free
	And God the just is satisfied 
	To look on Him and pardon me;	 To look on Him and pardon me

Behold Him there, the risen Lamb
My perfect, spotless righteousness 
The great unchangeable I Am 
The King of glory and of grace 
One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood 
My life is hid with Christ on high 
With Christ, my Saviour and my God;	With Christ, my Saviour and my God

 	 Hallelujah, Hallelujah
	Praise the One, Risen Son of God
