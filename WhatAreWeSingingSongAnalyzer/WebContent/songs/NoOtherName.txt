	There is no other name
	In heaven can be found 
	Through whom we are redeemed 
	Through whom your grace abounds 
	No other name can save 
	But Jesus Christ our Lord


My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears 
No other name but Jesus, Jesus 
My hope in darkest night 
My broken soul's delight 
No other name but Jesus, Jesus 

There is no victory 
But Jesus crucified 
No other cure for sin 
But that our Saviour died 
No other hope we have 
But that he rose again 

No other throne endures 
No other song remains 
But worthy is the Lamb 
Who was for sinners slain 
When every knee shall bow 
And tongue confess you are Lord, 
You are Lord
