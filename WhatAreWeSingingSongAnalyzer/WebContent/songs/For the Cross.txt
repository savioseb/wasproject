I will love You for the cross
And I will love You for the cost
Man of sufferings, Bringer of my peace.
You came into a world of shame
And paid the price we could not pay
Death that brought me life,
Blood that brought me home.
Death that brought me life, 
Blood that brought me home.

And I love You for the cross,
Im overwhelmed by the mystery,
I love You for the cross,
That Jesus You would do this for me.
When You were broken, You were beaten,
You were punished,  I go free,
When You were wounded and rejected,
In Your mercy, 	 I am healed.

Jesus Christ the sinner Friend
Does this kindness know no bounds?
With Your precious blood You have purchased me.
O,  the mystery of the cross
You were punished, You were crushed
But that punishment has become my peace
Yes, that punishment has become my peace
