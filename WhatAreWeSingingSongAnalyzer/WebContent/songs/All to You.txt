All to You the King of kings
All to You the living God
Lifted high for all the world to see
Who could e'er compare to Thee
Author of eternity
Picture of perfection found on earth


Now unto Your awesomeness
Self sustained in holiness
Creator of a world 
Saviour of a soul
    

                All hail and praise the King of heaven
                Exalt, exalt His Holy Name


Exalted to the highest place,
Eternal King Your Name be praised,
Beyond the rule of time and space
You reign
Majesty, Your majesty
All praise it must arise to Thee
I will serve no other God but You
