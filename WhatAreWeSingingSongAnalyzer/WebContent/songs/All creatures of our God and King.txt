All creatures of our God and King, lift up your voice and with us sing
O praise Him, Alleluia
Thou burning sun with golden beam, thou silver moon with softer gleam
O praise Him, O praise Him, Alleluia, Alleluia, Allelu  --  ia

Thou rushing wind that art so strong, ye clouds that sail in heavâ€™n along
O praise Him, Alleluia
Thou rising moon in praise rejoice, ye lights of evening find a voice
O praise Him, O praise Him, Alleluia, Alleluia, Allelu  --  ia

Let all things their Creator bless, and worship Him with humbleness
Praise, Praise the Father, praise the Son and praise the Spirit, three in One
O praise Him, O praise Him, Alleluia, Alleluia, Allelu  --  ia

O Alleluia, Alleluia
O Alleluia, Alleluia
O Alleluia, Alleluia
O Alleluia, Alleluia
