Blessed be your name  in the land that is plentiful 
Where your streams of abundance flow,  blessed be your name 
Blessed be your name  when I’m found in the desert place 
Though I walk through the wilderness,  blessed be your name 
     
 
Every blessing you pour out  I’ll turn back to praise 
When the darkness closes in Lord still I will say

 
Blessed be the name of the Lord  blessed be your name 
Blessed be the name of the Lord  blessed be your glorious name 

Blessed be your name  when the sun’s shining down on me 
When the world’s “all as it should be”  blessed be your name 
Blessed be your name  on the road marked with suffering 
Though there’s pain in the offering  blessed be your name 
     
You give and take away  you give and take away 
My heart will choose to say  Lord blessed be your name
