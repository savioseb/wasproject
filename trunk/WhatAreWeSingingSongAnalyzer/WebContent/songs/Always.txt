My foes are many, they rise against me
But I will hold my ground
I will not fear the war, I will not fear the storm
My help is on the way, my help is on the way


Oh my God, He will not delay
My refuge and strength always
I will not fear, His promise is true
My God will come through always, always

Trouble surrounding, chaos abounding
My soul will rest in You
I will not fear the war, I will not fear the storm
My help is on the way, my help is on the way

I lift my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord
From You Lord, From You Lord
