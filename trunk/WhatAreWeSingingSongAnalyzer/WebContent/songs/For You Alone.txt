Great and awesome are your deeds 
   Oh God Almighty 
Just and true are your ways 
   King of the Nations! 

        Who will not fear you O LORD? 
        Who will not glorify Your name? 

For you alone are holy, All nations will bow down 
For you alone are worthy, the Lamb upon the throne                              
Upon a cross he died, the perfect sacrifice 
All glory to the holy Lamb of God! 

      Jesus, our great reward, always 
      The saviour of our souls, we praise your name
