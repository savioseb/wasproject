Come and see, come and see
Come and see the King of love
   See the purple robe 
and crown of thorns he wears
Soldiers mock, rulers sneer
As he lifts the cruel cross
    Lone and friendless now 
he climbs towards the hill

We worship at your feet
Where wrath and mercy meet
And a guilty world is washed
By love pure stream
For us he was made sin
Oh, help me take it in
Deep wounds of love cry out 
Father, forgive
I worship,    I worship
The Lamb                 who was slain

Come and weep, come and mourn
For your sin that pierced him there
So much deeper than the wounds of thorn and nail 
All our pride, all our greed
All our fallenness and shame
And the Lord has laid the punishment on him

Man of heaven, born to earth 
To restore us to your heaven 
Here we bow in awe beneath 
Your searching eyes
From your tears comes our joy
From your death our life shall spring
By your resurrection power we shall rise
