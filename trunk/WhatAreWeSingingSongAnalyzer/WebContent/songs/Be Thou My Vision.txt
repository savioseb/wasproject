Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light
 
	Be Thou my wisdom and Thou my true Word
	I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord
	Thou my great Father, I Thy true son
	Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one

Be Thou my battle-shield, sword for my fight
Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight
Thou my soul shelter, Thou my tower
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power

	Riches I need not, nor man’s empty praise
	Thou mine inheritance, now and always
	Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
	High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

Oh God be my everything, be my delight
Jesus my glory, my soul satisfied

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heaven’s joys, bright heav’ns Son
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
Still be my vision, O ruler of all
