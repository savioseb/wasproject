Give thanks to the Lord our God & King
His love endures forever
For He is good, He is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise, Sing praise


With a mighty hand and outstretched arm
His love endures forever  
For the life  been reborn
His love endures forever
Sing praise, Sing praise
Sing praise, Sing praise

Forever God is faithful, forever God is strong
Forever God is with us, forever and ever

From the rising to the setting sun  His love endures forever
By the grace of God we will carry on
His love endures forever
