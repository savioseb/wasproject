Come thou fount of every blessing 
Tune my heart to sing thy grace 
Streams of mercy never ceasing 
Call for songs of loudest praise 

Teach me some melodious sonnet 
Sung by ﬂaming tongues above
I praise the mount Im ﬁxed upon it
Mount of thy redeeming love 



Here I praise Thee, ever faithful
Hither by Thine help, Im come
And I hope by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

Jesus sought me when a stranger 
Wondering from the fold of God 
He, to rescue me from danger 
interposed His precious blood


O to grace how great a debtor 
daily Im constrained to be! 
Let thy goodness like a fetter, 
bind my wandering heart to thee 

Prone to wander Lord I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love 
Here my heart, O take and seal it, 
seal it for thy courts above
  
	
Oh to Jesus, my fount of every blessing
Oh to Jesus, all glory and honour be
Oh to Jesus, my fount of every blessing
Oh to Jesus,  forever my treasure be

Oh to Jesus, Lord and Saviour
Thine own blood has purchased me
All I am, I gladly offer
for Thy glory, I shall be
