Wonderful, so wonderful, is Your unfailing love,
Your cross has spoken mercy over me
No eye has seen, no ear has heard. No heart could fully know,
How glorious, how beautiful You are.

Beautiful One, I love.  Beautiful One, I adore
Beautiful One my soul must sing.

Powerful, so powerful, Your glory fills the skies.
Your mighty works displayed for all to see.
The beauty of Your majesty, awakes my heart to sing;
How marvelous, how wonderful You are.

You ve opened my eyes to Your wonders anew.
You captured my heart with this love
Because nothing on earth is as beautiful as You

My soul, my soul must sing
My soul, my soul must sing
My soul, my soul must sing
Beautiful One
