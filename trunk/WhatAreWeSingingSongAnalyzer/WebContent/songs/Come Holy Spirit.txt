Dwell within our hearts
Our minds from bondage free
Then shall we know and praise and love
The Father, Son and Thee

Convince us of our sin
Then lead to Jesus blood;
And to our wondering view reveal
The mercies of our God

Come Holy Spirit come
Let Thy bright beams arise
dispel the shadows from our minds
Thy bright beams arise
dispel the darkness from our eyes
Revealing the wondrous light of Christ

Tis Thine to cleanse the heart
To sanctify the soul,
To pour fresh life in every part
And new create the whole

Revive our drooping faith,
Our doubts and fears remove,
And kindle in our breasts the flame
Of never-dying love
